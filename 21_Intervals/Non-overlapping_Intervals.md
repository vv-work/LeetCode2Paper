# [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals)

## Description

<p>Given an array of intervals <code>intervals</code> where <code>intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code>, return <em>the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that intervals which only touch at a point are <strong>non-overlapping</strong>. For example, <code>[1, 2]</code> and <code>[2, 3]</code> are non-overlapping.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You don&#39;t need to remove any of the intervals since they&#39;re already non-overlapping.
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= intervals.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>intervals[i].length == 2</code></li>
	<li><code>-5 * 10<sup>4</sup> &lt;= start<sub>i</sub> &lt; end<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Sorting + Greedy

We first sort the intervals in ascending order by their right boundary. We use a variable $\textit{pre}$ to record the right boundary of the previous interval and a variable $\textit{ans}$ to record the number of intervals that need to be removed. Initially, $\textit{ans} = \textit{intervals.length}$.

Then we iterate through the intervals. For each interval:

-   If the left boundary of the current interval is greater than or equal to $\textit{pre}$, it means that this interval does not need to be removed. We directly update $\textit{pre}$ to the right boundary of the current interval and decrement $\textit{ans}$ by one;
-   Otherwise, it means that this interval needs to be removed, and we do not need to update $\textit{pre}$ and $\textit{ans}$.

Finally, we return $\textit{ans}$.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of intervals.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        ans = len(intervals)
        pre = -inf
        for l, r in intervals:
            if pre <= l:
                ans -= 1
                pre = r
        return ans
```

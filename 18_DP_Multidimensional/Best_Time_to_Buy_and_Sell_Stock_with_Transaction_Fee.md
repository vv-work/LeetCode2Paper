# [714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee)

[中文文档](/solution/0700-0799/0714.Best%20Time%20to%20Buy%20and%20Sell%20Stock%20with%20Transaction%20Fee/README.md)

## Description

<p>You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day, and an integer <code>fee</code> representing a transaction fee.</p>

<p>Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).</li>
	<li>The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 8
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices[i] &lt; 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= fee &lt; 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Memoization

We design a function $dfs(i, j)$, which represents the maximum profit that can be obtained starting from day $i$ with state $j$. Here, $j$ can take the values $0$ and $1$, representing not holding and holding a stock, respectively. The answer is $dfs(0, 0)$.

The execution logic of the function $dfs(i, j)$ is as follows:

If $i \geq n$, there are no more stocks to trade, so we return $0$.

Otherwise, we can choose not to trade, in which case $dfs(i, j) = dfs(i + 1, j)$. We can also choose to trade stocks. If $j \gt 0$, it means that we currently hold a stock and can sell it. In this case, $dfs(i, j) = prices[i] + dfs(i + 1, 0) - fee$. If $j = 0$, it means that we currently do not hold a stock and can buy one. In this case, $dfs(i, j) = -prices[i] + dfs(i + 1, 1)$. We take the maximum value as the return value of the function $dfs(i, j)$.

The answer is $dfs(0, 0)$.

To avoid redundant calculations, we use memoization to record the return value of $dfs(i, j)$ in an array $f$. If $f[i][j]$ is not equal to $-1$, it means that we have already calculated it, so we can directly return $f[i][j]$.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the length of the array $prices$.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        @cache
        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> int:
            if i >= len(prices):
                return 0
            ans = dfs(i + 1, j)
            if j:
                ans = max(ans, prices[i] + dfs(i + 1, 0) - fee)
            else:
                ans = max(ans, -prices[i] + dfs(i + 1, 1))
            return ans

        return dfs(0, 0)
```

### Solution 2: Dynamic Programming

We define $f[i][j]$ as the maximum profit that can be obtained up to day $i$ with state $j$. Here, $j$ can take the values $0$ and $1$, representing not holding and holding a stock, respectively. We initialize $f[0][0] = 0$ and $f[0][1] = -prices[0]$.

When $i \geq 1$, if we do not hold a stock at the current day, then $f[i][0]$ can be obtained by transitioning from $f[i - 1][0]$ and $f[i - 1][1] + prices[i] - fee$, i.e., $f[i][0] = \max(f[i - 1][0], f[i - 1][1] + prices[i] - fee)$. If we hold a stock at the current day, then $f[i][1]$ can be obtained by transitioning from $f[i - 1][1]$ and $f[i - 1][0] - prices[i]$, i.e., $f[i][1] = \max(f[i - 1][1], f[i - 1][0] - prices[i])$. The final answer is $f[n - 1][0]$.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the length of the array $prices$.

We notice that the transition of the state $f[i][]$ only depends on $f[i - 1][]$ and $f[i - 2][]$. Therefore, we can use two variables $f_0$ and $f_1$ to replace the array $f$, reducing the space complexity to $O(1)$.

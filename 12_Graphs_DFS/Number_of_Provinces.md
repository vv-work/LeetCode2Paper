# [547. Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces)

## Description

<p>There are <code>n</code> cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city <code>a</code> is connected directly with city <code>b</code>, and city <code>b</code> is connected directly with city <code>c</code>, then city <code>a</code> is connected indirectly with city <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>province</strong> is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.</p>

<p>You are given an <code>n x n</code> matrix <code>isConnected</code> where <code>isConnected[i][j] = 1</code> if the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> city and the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> city are directly connected, and <code>isConnected[i][j] = 0</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>Return <em>the total number of <strong>provinces</strong></em>.</p>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: DFS

We create an array $\textit{vis}$ to record whether each city has been visited.

Next, we traverse each city $i$. If the city has not been visited, we start a depth-first search from that city. Using the matrix $\textit{isConnected}$, we find the cities directly connected to this city. These cities and the current city belong to the same province. We continue the depth-first search for these cities until all cities in the same province have been visited. This counts as one province, so we increment the answer $\textit{ans}$ by $1$. Then, we move to the next unvisited city and repeat the process until all cities have been traversed.

Finally, return the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n^2)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the number of cities.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def dfs(i: int):
            vis[i] = True
            for j, x in enumerate(isConnected[i]):
                if not vis[j] and x:
                    dfs(j)

        n = len(isConnected)
        vis = [False] * n
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if not vis[i]:
                dfs(i)
                ans += 1
        return ans
```

### Solution 2: Union-Find

We can also use the union-find data structure to maintain each connected component. Initially, each city belongs to a different connected component, so the number of provinces is $n$.

Next, we traverse the matrix $\textit{isConnected}$. If there is a connection between two cities $(i, j)$ and they belong to two different connected components, they will be merged into one connected component, and the number of provinces is decremented by $1$.

Finally, return the number of provinces.

The time complexity is $O(n^2 \times \log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the number of cities, and $\log n$ is the time complexity of path compression in the union-find data structure.
